- Server is the **single source of truth**
- All AI, movement, collisions run **server-side**
- Client is a **read-only renderer** (no authority)
- Same world state visible to all connected clients
- Create and manage the world lifecycle
- Maintain navigation grid and static objects
- Spawn, update, and destroy entities (animals)
- Run AI state machines and movement logic
- Handle collisions with borders and walls
- Tile/grid-based (ideal for isometric view)
- Never exposed as logic to the client
